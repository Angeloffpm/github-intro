# An (oversimplified, unqualified) introduction to Github!

Hooray!! Exciting times in 2275—we've finished the most recent midterm, and are turning our gazes to the Next Big Thing!  

As I'm sure we're all aware, this consists of a fun project, the shape and size of which is determined individually (or, in groups, I suppose). This means no (true) writeup full of explicit instructions; rather, some free-form goodness! With this freedom comes the need for great... accountability? Sure.

Enter: Github!!

We've decided to require the use of Github in your projects for several reasons—some logistical, some not; all good for you! Github (and/or, Git, an introduction to which is outside of the scope of this class) is standard in all walks in which Average Cathy the CSCI'ist will find themselves employed. This fact arises from a nigh-universal need for **Version Control**!!

# Version Control
**Let's not kid ourselves**. We've all submitted something along the lines of Final_Paper_aaaa111.pdf in our educational careers. We should take this as an opportunity to reflect: this naming scheme reflects very little about the state of our ostensibly final draft! Is this version *actually* the final? If not, what did we change *between* the creation of this draft, and the subsequent drafts? The answers to these questions are lost in the ether, hopelessly lost. While this may not be terribly consequential for paper drafting, programming, software development—coding in general is an entirely different beast, since the changes you make in your code have consequences.
